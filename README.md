Assignment Summary

I like this assignment because it is getting more familiar with interfaces in Java, and I also like the freedom where we can choose any language. 
However, I do feel that the assignment lacks details on what is being graded which makes me weary of my final project. 
The rubric looks for working code however, does not explain what we should turn in. I have chosen to include a class and interface that creates 
in-memory key-value database that supports the required functions. However, should I have also included a main that tested this if the code had 
to be working? I am also afraid that the code will not work for other users while it works for me, I feel that maybe a screenshot of the desired 
output and a link to a repository might be better to ensure functionality.
